<h2>About</h2>
<p>
  <b><i>Black Diamond</i></b>, a fork of the great Android chess app named <b><i>Droidfish</i></b> developed by <b><i>Peter Österlund</b></i>.  <b><i>Black Diamond</i></b> is a feature-rich graphical chess and is combined here with a <b><i>Baker's Dozen</i></b> of very strong <b><i>Stockfish</i></b> chess engines and otehrs that just fun to play.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Engines</i></b>:
<p>
  <b><i>Black Diamond</i></b>, based on the great problem solver <b><i>Stockfish</i></b> clone <b><i>Crystal</i></b> issued by my good friend <b><i>Joe Ellis</i></b> from time to time.
</p>
<p>
  <b><i>Bluefish</i></b>, another <b><i>Stockfish</i></b> clone, originally issued by my good friend <b><i>Eelco de Groot</b></i>, in classical search mode, places a ~22 percent greater emphasis on positional evaluation functions by reducing piece values.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, <b><i>Honey</i></b> and <b><i>Oki Maguro</i></b>, are also included.  <b><i>Honey</i></b> uses classical evaluation less often than current-dev-Stockfish and <b><i>Oki Maguro</i></b> is very close to current-dev-Stockfish and is named in honor of our friends in <b><i>Japan</i></b>, who first introduced Neural Net learning in <b><i>Stockfish</i></b>.
</p>

<p>
    <b><i>Oki Maguro</i></b> translates to <b><i>Big Tuna</i></b> in Japanese. Neural Net learning increased <b><i>Stockfish’s</i></b> ELo rating by 150 Elo in a two-month span, enabling <b><i>Stockfish</i></b> to solidified its reputation as the strongest freely available chess engine in the world.
</p>
<p>
  Also, I must call out and tip my hat to the very creative and hardworking <a href=https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish/blob/master/AUTHORS> <b><i>Stockfish Authors team</i></b></a>. They epitomize the benefits of open source software and the quality that can be achieved by collaboration from the hundreds of developers around the world who have contributed.  In this package , I have included the great Stockfish fork, <b><i>Cfish</i></b> by <b><i>Ronald De Mann</i></b> and <b><i>Stockfish 6</i></b>, the first <b><i>Stockfish</i></b> release which supported syzygy tablebases.
</p>
  In this release, I am pleased to announce the addition <b><i>Ethereal 2.75</i></b>, perhaps no other engine ever climbed the Elo ladder faster than <b><i>Ethereal</i></b>.  In just a little over 5 years, it has reached the number two ranking of Open Source engines behind <b><i>Stockfish</i></b>.  Great work by <b><i>Andy Grant</i></b> and his team of <b><i>contributors</i></b>.
<p>
  Also included are three strong and stable engines: <b><i>Andscacs v.0921</i></b> by <b><i>Daniel José Queraltó</i></b>, and <b><i>Fruit 2.1</i></b> and <b><i>Senpai 1.0</i></b>, both by <b><i>Fabien Letouzey</i></b>.
<p>
  <b><i>Shallow Blue 2.0</i></b>, by <b><i>Rhys Rustad-Elliott</i></b>, is also included. A rock solid stable engine that may play close to <b><i>FIDE 1850</i></b> on an Android device. A very nice engine for humans to play.
</p>
<p>
  Previously we added a color theme <b><i>Night</i></b>. As the name implies, it is a dark theme for those situations where you want to keep the light down — particularly at night.  With this release, we introduce new time controls with very fast time controls in <b><i>Milliseconds</i></b> and a setting called <b><i>Engine Sleep</i></b> — used to put the engine to sleep for a a few seconds before making its move. A perfect combination to weaken the engine naturally while not having it move instantly. I always appreciated the ability to ponder while the engine is on the clock.
</p>
<p>
  This <b><i>Black Diamond</i></b> Android app is issued by me, <b><i>Michael Byrne — michaelbyrne1978@gmail.com</i></b>. Please do not contact <b><i>Peter Österlund</i></b> for any help or questions regarding this app as he was not involved in the release of this app other than developing the <b><i>Droidfish</i></b> code that was used in this app as previously mentioned.

<h3>Opening books</h3>
<p>
  DroidFish contains a small internal opening book. If you want to use
  a larger book, you can configure DroidFish to use external <i>polyglot</i>
  or <i>CTG</i> book files:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Copy one or more polyglot book files to the <i>DroidFish/book</i> directory on the SD card.
    Polyglot books must have the file extension <i>.bin</i>.
    <b>Note!</b> The Android file system is case sensitive, so the extension must be <i>.bin</i>, not <i>.Bin</i> or <i>.BIN</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Copy one or more CTG book files to the <i>DroidFish/book</i> directory.
    A CTG book consists of three files with file extensions <i>.ctg</i>, <i>.ctb</i> and <i>.cto</i>.
    You must copy all three files.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the program menu, activate the <i>Select opening book</i> function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the opening book file you want to use.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>PGN files</h3>
<p>
  DroidFish can load games from PGN files.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Copy one or more PGN files to the <i>DroidFish/pgn</i> directory on the SD card.
  </li>
  <li>
    Long press the chess board and select <i>Load game from PGN file</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the file, then the game within the file you want to load.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  To edit game headers such as player names, long press the move list and select
  <i>Edit Headers</i>. To edit comments for a move, long press the move list and
  select <i>Edit Comments</i>.
</p>
<p>
  To save your edited game, long press the chess board and select <i>Save game to
    PGN file</i>. Select the file to save to, then select the position in the file
  where the new game will be saved.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Note!</b> If the <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openintents.filemanager">OI File Manager</a> is installed, any directory can be used to load/save games.
</p>
<p>
  To add computer analysis to the game tree, long press the analysis information when the computer is thinking and select <i>Add Analysis</i>.
  The current principal variation is added as a variation in the game tree.
</p>
<p>
  In analysis mode, it is possible to add null moves to the game tree. Be aware though
  that null moves are not included in the PGN standard and may not work in other PGN
  reading chess programs.
</p>

<h3>Scid files</h3>
<p>
  If you have <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.scid.android">Scid on the go</a> installed, you can read Scid database files directly from DroidFish.
  Long press the chess board and select <i>Load game from Scid file</i>.
</p>

<h3>FEN/EPD files</h3>
<p>
  DroidFish can load positions from FEN/EPD files.

  </li>
  <li>
    Select the file, then the position within the file you want to load.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  You can also load positions from external programs, such as <a href="http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kgroth.chessocr">ChessOcr</a> (non-free), which will let you use the camera to take a picture of a chess diagram and automatically set up the position in DroidFish.
</p>

  </li>
  <li>
