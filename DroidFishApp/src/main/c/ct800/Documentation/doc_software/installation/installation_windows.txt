******************************************************************************
This file contains the instructions how to install the executable under
Windows. Note that there is no GUI included because the engine is intended to
be used with chess GUIs like Arena or Winboard via the UCI protocol.
******************************************************************************

- Choose the correct engine version for your PC:
    - AMD or Intel x86 processor (most likely):
        - 64 bit Windows (most likely): use the _x64.exe version.
        - 32 bit Windows: use the _x32.exe version.
    - ARM processor (Windows 10 on ARM):
        - 64 bit Windows (most likely): use the _a64.exe version.
        - 32 bit Windows: use the _a32.exe version.

- Use the Windows explorer and go to the program directory of your chess GUI,
  e.g.
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Arena\Engines\
  or
  C:\Program Files (x86)\WinBoard-4.8.0\ .
- Create the directory "CT800".
- Copy the Windows executable from the binaries\Windows  directory in the ZIP
  download file to that "CT800" directory.
- You may also copy the logo PNGs from the Logo-Images directory in the ZIP
  download file.
- Follow the instructions of your chess GUI how to register the engine with
  your chess GUI.
- The CT800 engine supports the UCI protocol only. You should select "use
  engine book" because the opening book is tuned to the engine's style.

Note: The opening book is contained in the EXE file, as well as the endgame
      bitbase for KPK, so there are no additional paths to configure.

Note: The engine uses 8 MB as default size for the hash tables. For better
      performance, 256 MB are recommended, which you can control through your
      GUI.
